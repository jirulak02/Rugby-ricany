# rugby-ricany - 2023

Here I helped with a website for our local rugby team. I worked on loading match data from Google Sheets and filtering it by need. The website is made in a CMS editor, so I was limited to only HTML files. This made me realize how much I love React, Tailwind and TypeScript. The code is a mess because Google Sheets handles some empty cells very strangely. (see JSON files for reference)
